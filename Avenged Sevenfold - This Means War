[Verse 1]
Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die, watch the scythe usher me astray
I can’t go on this way, not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun, pull back on all who run
A coward’s truth inside the wrong

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war

[Verse 2]
Lash your tongue of bane, carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust, battle never ends
Lie, mask the pain of a child who’s forsaken
Lie to myself, praise the new regime
I left me long ago, reasons you’ll never know
No one to miss me when I’m gone
With no more words to say, no argument to stay
Another post I don’t belong

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
